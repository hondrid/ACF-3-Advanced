# Armored Combat Framework - Advanced
> A standardized combat and damage addon for Garry's Mod

Armored Combat Framework (ACF) Advanced is an addon for Garry's Mod that takes the idea of ACF 3 and implements full heat cycle and pressure dynamics for engines, 

This is very alpha stage, so there will be bugs there will be weird things, as well as incorrect values, balance will be investigated once core systems are implemented.

## Installation

### Dependencies
    ACF Requires these to work

Wiremod ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=160250458) or [Github](https://github.com/wiremod))
Contraption Framework ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3154971187) or [Github](https://github.com/ACF-Team/CFW))

Prop Protection with [CPPI](http://ulyssesmod.net/archive/CPPI_v1-3.pdf) is not required, but highly recommended. We'd recommend Nadmod PP ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=159298542) or [Github](https://github.com/Nebual/NadmodPP)).

ACF works best when used with thin plate models and SProps ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173482196)) provides a more complete selection over the vanilla PHX plates.


### Git Client (Recommended)

Install a Git client, such as the [Github client](https://desktop.github.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), then clone ACF to your addons folder. With the Github client installed you can click the green button at the top of the ACF repo page and select clone. Updating ACF on your server or client after install simply requires clicking the pull button in your respective Git client.

### Manually

1. Click the green button at the top of the ACF repo and select zip.
2. Extract the ACF folder.
3. Inside you will find another ACF folder.
4. Move the inner ACF folder to `garrysmod/garrysmod/addons`
